# Pet Discovery 

Pet Discovery is a web application that enables users to review different types of dog breeds to determine what kind of breed is best for them!

Users have the ability to login, search and like different types of dog breeds. Additionally, I have included a link at the top of each page that directs the user to PetFinder.com to search for local, available dogs in their area!

The API I used to render the dog breeds and information: https://thedogapi.com/
